                        <p class="lorem_text"><i>The Catcher in the Rye</i> is a novel by J.D. Salinger that was first published in 1951. It is a coming-of-age story that follows the protagonist, Holden Caulfield, as he navigates his way through adolescence and adulthood in New York City. 
                           The literary analysis performed on the writer&rsquo;s background, as well as, on the recurring semantic themes present in the last two chapters of the novel, led to the formation of semantic classes.
                           These classes give a detailed focus onto the novel&rsquo;s main thematics which helped shape the novel&rsquo;s ontology developed on WebOwl. The chapters have been chosen as a source rich of themes underlying the language used by the author. 
                           The scope of this project is thus focused on literary interpretation and analysis.

                     <p class="lorem_text">Through a deep study of the text, we decided to distinguish the tokens in grammatical and semantic classes.
                        <br>As for the <span class="highlighted">grammatical classes</span> we considered the tokens which replied to the question <span class="object"><i>what?</i></span> as objects, those who replied to the question <span class="properName"><i>who?</i></span> as proper names, <span class="movement">movement verbs</span> leading to a movement in the main character, <span class="static">static verbs</span> where the situation remains still for a certain amount of time; qualitative <span class="adj">adjectives</span> (<i>how?</i>).
                        <br><br>As for the <span class="highlighted">thematic classes</span>, which are more semantically relevant for the meaning of the novel there are body-related tokens, which are divided in <span class="body">body parts</span> (ex. <i>eyes</i>), <span class="needs">physical needs</span> (ex. <i>sleep</i>), <span class="state">physical state</span> (ex. <i>asleep</i>). Holden&rsquo;s journey was both mental and physical, that&rsquo;s why the body takes a big part of the metadata.
                        <br>The <span class="materialism">materialism</span> class was chosen because Holden&rsquo;s life is spent wandering around, so this element of realism is important to understand the physical constraints of the body: one needs money to move out.
                        <br>The <span class="slang">slangs</span> took out a big part of the text: more often present in direct conversations or in the protagonist&rsquo;s thoughts, these words are important to underline the contextual roughness that Salinger adopted in taking the boy&rsquo;s point of view. With the &rsquo;phoniness&rsquo; of the world, for example, the writer wants to underline the phase of life called adolescence, in which one doesn&rsquo;t feel to be part of neither adulthood, nor childhood anymore.
                        <br><span class="time">Time expressions</span> are a useful tool to distinguish between the real passing time and the mental perceived time by the protagonist.
                        <br><span class="place">Places</span> are changed so frequently to underline the lost feeling which is the constant, also underlined by Holden&rsquo;s name. <i>Hold-en</i> means hold on, keep on going; <i>Caul-field</i>: the caul is the protective covering that encloses the field of innocence. Holden tries to remain a child, but he is not anymore; he can not understand the adult world, so his only possibility is to be a Catcher in the Rye: the one who protects children from falling down the cliff of adulthood, well aware that he can not protect everyone.
                        <br>The black connotation refers to <span class="neg">negative</span> physical and mental states.
                        <br><br>Throughout the text we found that some tokens could have had multiple membership classes: in these ambiguous cases, the chosen class was the one most prevalent according to the meaning of the text. For example, when a word is both an object and a slang, the prevailing class is always the thematic one. In other cases where a world is both a physical state like <i>headache</i>, but it has a negative connotation, the negative prevails. The adopting criteria was that of always choosing the prevailing membership class.

                        <li>Turtle: reference ontologies on the web, starting point of the ontology: querying to find the relationship between superclass, property and subclass. Turtle is the ontology declaration: you can see the relation between the triplets; you can see that a subject has multiple properties/relations.</li>
                        <li>Once the relationship is established, the turtle URIs are exported in owl format.</li>
                        <li>The turtle file in owl format is then debugged on Protégé. You can read about the ontology evaluation <a href="evaluation.html" class="qui">here</a>.</li>
                        <li>The debugged final version is then converted into json and uploaded on WebOWL.                        </li>
                        <li>WebOWL is the tool used to extract a graphical representation from the Turtle querying. </li>
                        <li>All entities in our ontology start from the URI and add after # the name of the subclass. If you click on any property you download the turtle in owl format where you can see the entities of every defined element. Look for word details on properties in <a href="indexo.html" class="qui">webOWL</a>. </li>
                        <li>The final tool used was LODE, adopted to get a tabular representation of the graphical ontology; the process was that of inserting the URL we imported the ontology on Github: subject, IRI (general identifier of the class), has super-classes (property), expression of place (object).
