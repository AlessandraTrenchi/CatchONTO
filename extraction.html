                           <span class="pink">When</span> <span class="lightBlue">I got</span> <span class="purple">outside</span>, it was <span class="middleBlue">just</span> getting <span class="red">light</span> <span class="purple">out</span>. It was <span class="middleBlue">pretty cold, too</span>, 
                           but it <span class="brown">felt good</span> because I was <span class="brown">sweating</span> <span class="middleBlue">so much</span>. I didn't <span class="green">know</span> <span class="purple">where</span> <span class="grey">the hell</span> <span class="lightBlue">to go</span>. 
                           I didn't <span class="green">want</span> <span class="lightBlue">to go</span> to <span class="middleBlue">another</span> <span class="purple">hotel</span> and <span class="lightGreen">spend</span> <span class="middleBlue">all</span> <span class="blue">Phoebe's</span> <span class="lightGreen">dough</span>. 
                           So <span class="pink">finally</span> all I did was I <span class="lightBlue">walked over</span> <span class="purple">to Lexington</span> and <span class="lightBlue">took </span><span class="red">the subway</span> <span class="purple">down to Grand Central</span>. My <span class="red">bags</span> were<span class="purple"> there</span> 
                           <span class="grey">and all</span>, and I <span class="green">figured</span> I'd <span class="yellow">sleep</span> <span class="purple">in that </span><span class="black">crazy</span> <span class="purple">waiting room where</span> <span class="middleBlue">all </span><span class="red">the benches</span> are. So that's <span class="red">what</span> I did.  
                           It <span class="grey">wasn't too bad</span> <span class="pink">for a while</span> because there weren't <span class="middleBlue">many</span> <span class="red">people</span> <span class="purple">around</span> and I could <span class="lightBlue">stick</span> my <span class="orange">feet</span> <span class="lightBlue">up</span>. But I don't <span class="grey">feel </span><span class="middleBlue">much</span> <span class="grey">like </span>discussing <span class="red">it</span>. 
                           It wasn't <span class="middleBlue">too nice</span>. Don't <span class="pink">ever</span> try<span class="red"> it</span>. I mean<span class="red"> it</span>. It'll <span class="black">depress</span> <span class="red">you</span>. I <span class="middleBlue">only</span> <span class="yellow">slept </span><span class="pink">till around nine o'clock</span> because <span class="middleBlue">a million</span> people started <span class="lightBlue">coming</span><span class="purple"> in the waiting room</span> and I had to <span class="lightBlue">take</span> my <span class="orange">feet</span> <span class="lightBlue">down</span>. 
                           I can't <span class="yellow">sleep</span> so <span class="brown">hot</span> if I have to <span class="green">keep</span> my <span class="orange">feet</span> <span class="purple">on the floor</span>. So I <span class="lightBlue">sat up</span>. I <span class="pink">still</span> had that <span class="black">headache</span>. It was <span class="middleBlue">even</span> <span class="black">worse</span>. And I <span class="green">think</span> I was <span class="middleBlue">more</span> <span class="black">depressed </span>than I <span class="pink">ever</span> was <span class="pink">in my whole life</span>. 
                           I didn't <span class="green">want</span> to, but I started <span class="green">thinking </span>about <span class="grey">old</span> <span class="blue">Mr. Antolini</span> and I <span class="green">wondered</span> <span class="red">what</span> he'd tell <span class="blue">Mrs. Antolini</span> <span class="pink">when</span> she saw I hadn't <span class="yellow">slept</span> <span class="purple">there</span> <span class="grey">or anything</span>. That part didn't <span class="black">worry</span> <span class="red">me</span> <span class="middleBlue">too much</span>, though, because I <span class="green">knew</span> <span class="blue">Mr. Antolini</span> was <span class="middleBlue">very smart</span> 
                           and that he could make up <span class="red">something</span> to tell her. He could tell her I'd <span class="lightBlue">gone </span><span class="purple">home</span> <span class="grey">or something</span>. That part didn't <span class="black">worry</span> <span class="red">me</span> <span class="middleBlue">much</span>. But <span class="red">what</span> did <span class="black">worry</span> <span class="red">me</span> was the part about <span class="middleBlue">how</span> I'd  <span class="brown">woke up</span> and found <span class="red">him</span> <span class="lightBlue">patting</span> <span class="red">me</span> <span class="purple">on the head</span> <span class="grey">and all</span>. 
                           I mean I <span class="green">wondered</span> if <span class="middleBlue">just maybe</span> I was <span class="middleBlue">wrong</span> about <span class="green">thinking</span> he was making a <span class="grey">flitty</span> <span class="red">pass</span> at me. I <span class="green">wondered</span> if <span class="middleBlue">maybe</span> he just liked <span class="lightBlue">to pat</span> <span class="red">guys</span> <span class="purple">on the head </span><span class="pink">when</span> they're <span class="brown">asleep</span>. I mean <span class="middleBlue">how</span> can you tell about that <span class="grey">stuff</span> <span class="middleBlue">for sure</span>? You can't. 
                           I <span class="middleBlue">even </span>started <span class="green">wondering</span> if <span class="middleBlue">maybe</span> I should've <span class="lightBlue">got</span> my <span class="red">bags</span> and <span class="lightBlue">gone back</span> <span class="purple">to his house</span>, <span class="middleBlue">the way</span> I'd said I would. I mean I started <span class="green">thinking</span> that <span class="middleBlue">even</span> if he was a <span class="grey">flit</span> he <span class="middleBlue">certainly'd</span> been <span class="middleBlue">very nice</span> to me. I <span class="green">thought</span> <span class="middleBlue">how </span>he <span class="green">hadn't minded</span> 
                           <span class="red">it</span> <span class="pink">when</span> I'd called <span class="red">him</span> up <span class="middleBlue">so</span> <span class="pink">late</span>, and <span class="middleBlue">how</span> he'd told me to <span class="lightBlue">come</span> <span class="purple">right over</span> if I <span class="grey">felt like it</span>. And <span class="middleBlue">how</span> he<span class="lightBlue"> went</span> to <span class="middleBlue">all</span> that <span class="red">trouble</span> <span class="lightBlue">giving</span> me that <span class="red">advice</span>  about finding out <span class="red">the size of your mind</span> <span class="grey">and all,</span> and <span class="middleBlue">how</span> 
                           he was <span class="middleBlue">the only </span><span class="red">guy </span>that'd <span class="middleBlue">even</span> <span class="lightBlue">gone</span> <span class="purple">near that boy</span> <span class="blue">James Castle</span> I told you about <span class="pink">when</span> he was <span class="black">dead</span>. I <span class="green">thought</span> about <span class="middleBlue">all that</span> <span class="grey">stuff.</span> And the <span class="middleBlue">more</span> I <span class="green">thought</span> about <span class="red">it</span>, <span class="middleBlue">the more </span><span class="black">depressed</span> I got. I mean I started <span class="green">thinking</span> <span class="middleBlue">maybe</span> 
                           I should've <span class="lightBlue">gone back</span> <span class="purple">to his house</span>. <span class="middleBlue">Maybe</span> he was <span class="middleBlue">only</span> <span class="lightBlue">patting</span> my <span class="orange">head</span> <span class="middleBlue">just</span> <span class="grey">for the hell of it.</span> The more I <span class="green">thought</span> about it, though, <span class="middleBlue">the more</span> <span class="black">depressed</span> and 
                           <span class="grey">screwed up</span> about it I got. <span class="red">What</span> made it even <span class="black">worse</span>, my <span class="orange">eyes</span> were <span class="black">sore</span> <span class="grey">as hell.</span> They felt <span class="black">sore</span> and <span class="black">burny</span> from not getting too much <span class="yellow">sleep</span>. Besides that, I was getting <span class="grey">sort of</span> <span class="black">a cold</span>, and I didn't even have a <span class="grey">goddam</span> <span class="red">handkerchief </span><span class="middleBlue">with me</span>. I had <span class="red">some</span> <span class="purple">in my suitcase</span>, but I didn't <span class="grey">feel like</span> <span class="lightBlue">taking</span> 
                           <span class="red">it</span> <span class="lightBlue">out</span> of that <span class="middleBlue">strong</span> <span class="red">box</span> and <span class="lightBlue">opening</span> <span class="red">it</span> <span class="lightBlue">up</span> <span class="middleBlue">right</span> <span class="purple">in public</span> <span class="grey">and all.</span> There was this <span class="red">magazine</span> that somebody'd left <span class="purple">on the bench next to me</span>, so I started <span class="green">reading </span><span class="red">it</span>, <span class="green">thinking</span> it'd make me stop <span class="green">thinking</span> about <span class="blue">Mr. Antolini</span> and<span class="middleBlue"> 
                           a million other</span> <span class="red">things</span> <span class="pink">for</span> <span class="middleBlue">at least</span> <span class="pink">a</span> <span class="middleBlue">little </span><span class="pink">while</span>. But this <span class="grey">damn</span> <span class="red">article</span> I <span class="green">started reading</span> made me feel <span class="middleBlue">almost</span> <span class="black">worse</span>. It was all about <span class="orange">hormones</span>. It described <span class="middleBlue">how</span> you should look, your <span class="orange">face</span> and <span class="orange">eyes</span> <span class="grey">and all,</span> if your <span class="orange">hormones</span> were <span class="middleBlue">in good </span><span class="red">shape</span>, 
                           and I didn't look<span class="middleBlue"> that way at all</span>. I looked <span class="middleBlue">exactly like</span> the <span class="red">guy</span> <span class="purple">in the article</span> with <span class="grey">lousy</span> <span class="orange">hormones</span>. So I started getting <span class="black">worried </span>about my <span class="orange">hormones</span>. Then I <span class="green">read</span> <span class="middleBlue">this other</span> <span class="red">article</span> about <span class="middleBlue">how</span> you can tell if you have <span class="black">cancer</span> or not. It said if you had <span class="red">any</span> <span class="black">sores</span><span class="purple"> in your mouth</span> that didn't <span class="yellow">heal</span> 
                           <span class="middleBlue">pretty quickly</span>, it was <span class="red">a sign</span> that you <span class="middleBlue">probably</span> had <span class="black">cancer</span>. I'd had this <span class="black">sore</span> <span class="purple">on the inside</span> of my <span class="orange">lip </span><span class="pink">for</span> <span class="middleBlue">about</span> <span class="pink">two weeks</span>. So <span class="green">figured</span> I was getting <span class="black">cancer</span>. That <span class="red">magazine</span> was <span class="middleBlue">some little</span> <span class="grey">cheerer upper.</span> I <span class="pink">finally</span> quit <span class="green">reading</span> <span class="red">it</span> and <span class="lightBlue">went</span> <span class="purple">outside</span> for a walk. 
                           I <span class="green">figured</span> I'd be <span class="black">dead</span> <span class="pink">in a couple of months</span> because I had <span class="black">cancer</span>. I <span class="middleBlue">really</span> did. I was <span class="middleBlue">even positive</span> I would be. It <span class="middleBlue">certainly</span> didn't make me feel <span class="middleBlue">too gorgeous</span>. It'<span class="grey">sort of </span>looked like it was going to rain, but I <span class="lightBlue">went</span> for this walk <span class="middleBlue">anyway</span>. <span class="grey">For one thing</span>, I <span class="green">figured</span> I ought to <span class="lightBlue">get</span> <span class="middleBlue">some</span> <span class="red">breakfast</span>. I wasn't <span class="middleBlue">at all</span> <span class="brown">hungry</span>, but I <span class="green">figured</span> 
                           I ought to <span class="middleBlue">at least</span> <span class="yellow">eat </span><span class="red">something</span>. I mean <span class="middleBlue">at least </span><span class="lightBlue">get</span> <span class="red">something</span> with <span class="middleBlue">some</span> <span class="red">vitamins</span> <span class="purple">in it</span>. So I started <span class="lightBlue">walking</span> <span class="middleBlue">way</span> <span class="purple">over east, where</span> the <span class="middleBlue">pretty</span> <span class="lightGreen">cheap</span> <span class="purple">restaurants</span> are, because I didn't <span class="green">want</span> to <span class="lightGreen">spend</span> <span class="middleBlue">a lot of</span> <span class="lightGreen">dough</span>. <span class="pink">
                           While</span> I was <span class="lightBlue">walking</span>, I <span class="lightBlue">passed</span> <span class="middleBlue">these two</span> <span class="red">guys</span> that were <span class="lightBlue">unloading</span> this <span class="middleBlue">big</span> <span class="red">Christmas tree</span> <span class="purple">off a truck</span>. <span class="middleBlue">One</span> <span class="red">guy</span> kept saying to the <span class="middleBlue">other</span> <span class="red">guy</span>, "<span class="lightBlue">Hold</span> the <span class="grey">sonuvabitch</span> <span class="lightBlue">up! Hold</span> <span class="red">it</span> <span class="lightBlue">up</span>, <span class="grey">for Chrissake!</span>" It <span class="middleBlue">certainly </span>was a <span class="middleBlue">gorgeous way</span> to talk about a <span class="red">Christmas tree</span>.
                           It was <span class="grey">sort of</span> <span class="middleBlue">funny</span>, though, in an <span class="black">awful</span> <span class="middleBlue">way</span>, and I started to <span class="grey">sort of</span> laugh. It was about the <span class="black">worst</span> <span class="red">thing</span> I could've done, because <span class="pink">the minute</span> I started to laugh I <span class="green">thought</span> I was going to <span class="black">vomit</span>. I <span class="middleBlue">really</span> did. I <span class="middleBlue">even</span> started to, but it <span class="lightBlue">went away</span>. I don't <span class="green">know</span> <span class="red">why</span>. I mean I hadn't <span class="yellow">eaten</span> <span class="red">anything</span> <span class="black">unsanitary </span>or <span class="middleBlue">like</span>
                           <span class="red">that</span> and <span class="pink">usually</span> I have <span class="middleBlue">quite</span> a <span class="middleBlue">strong</span> <span class="orange">stomach</span>. <span class="middleBlue">Anyway</span>, I got over <span class="red">it</span>, and I <span class="green">figured</span> I'd <span class="brown">feel better</span> if I had <span class="red">something</span> to <span class="yellow">eat</span>. So I <span class="lightBlue">went</span> in this <span class="middleBlue">very</span> <span class="lightGreen">cheap-looking</span> <span class="purple">restaurant </span>and had <span class="red">doughnuts</span> and <span class="red">coffee</span>. <span class="middleBlue">Only</span>, I didn't <span class="yellow">eat</span> the <span class="red">doughnuts</span>. I couldn't <span class="yellow">swallow </span><span class="red">them</span> <span class="middleBlue">too well</span>. The thing is, 
                           if you get <span class="middleBlue">very </span><span class="black">depressed </span>about <span class="red">something</span>, it's <span class="middleBlue">hard</span> <span class="grey">as hell</span> to <span class="yellow">swallow</span>. The waiter was<span class="middleBlue"> very nice</span>, though. He <span class="lightBlue">took</span> <span class="red">them</span> <span class="lightBlue">back</span> without <span class="lightGreen">charging</span> <span class="red">me</span>. I <span class="middleBlue">just </span><span class="yellow">drank</span> the <span class="red">coffee</span>. Then I <span class="lightBlue">left</span> and started <span class="lightBlue">walking over</span> <span class="purple">toward Fifth Avenue</span>. It was <span class="pink">Monday </span><span class="grey">and all,</span> and <span class="middleBlue">pretty</span> <span class="pink">near Christmas</span>, 
                           and <span class="middleBlue">all </span><span class="purple">the stores</span> were <span class="middleBlue">open</span>. So it wasn't <span class="middleBlue">too bad</span> <span class="lightBlue">walking</span> <span class="purple">on Fifth Avenue</span>. It was <span class="middleBlue">fairly Christmasy</span>. All those <span class="grey">scraggylooking </span><span class="blue">Santa Clauses</span> were <span class="green">standing</span> <span class="purple">on corners</span> ringing those <span class="red">bells</span>, and the <span class="blue">Salvation Army </span><span class="red">girls</span>, the ones that don't <span class="green">wear</span> any <span class="red">lipstick</span> <span class="grey">or anything,</span> were tinging <span class="red">bells</span> <span class="middleBlue">too</span>. I <span class="grey">sort of</span> 
                           kept looking around for <span class="middleBlue">those two</span> <span class="red">nuns</span> I'd <span class="lightBlue">met</span> <span class="pink">at breakfast the day before</span>, but I didn't see <span class="red">them</span>. I <span class="green">knew </span>I wouldn't, because they'd told me they'd <span class="lightBlue">come</span> <span class="purple">to New York</span> to be <span class="red">schoolteachers</span>, but I kept looking for <span class="red">them</span> <span class="middleBlue">anyway</span>. <span class="middleBlue">Anyway</span>, it was <span class="middleBlue">pretty Christmasy</span><span class="pink"> all of a sudden</span>. <span class="middleBlue">A million little</span> <span class="red">kids</span> were <span class="purple">downtown </span>with their <span class="red">mothers</span>,
                           <span class="lightBlue">getting</span> <span class="purple">on and off buses</span> and <span class="lightBlue">coming</span> <span class="purple">in and out of stores</span>. I <span class="green">wished</span> <span class="grey">old</span> <span class="blue">Phoebe</span> was <span class="purple">around</span>. She's not <span class="middleBlue">little enough</span> <span class="pink">any more</span> <span class="lightBlue">to go</span> <span class="grey">stark staring</span> <span class="black">mad</span> <span class="purple">in the toy department</span>, but she enjoys <span class="grey">horsing around</span> and looking at the <span class="red">people</span>. The <span class="pink">Christmas before last</span> I <span class="lightBlue">took</span> <span class="red">her</span> <span class="purple">downtown </span>shopping <span class="middleBlue">with me</span>. 
                           We had a <span class="grey">helluva</span> <span class="pink">time</span>. I<span class="green"> think</span> <span class="red">it</span> was in <span class="purple">Bloomingdale's</span>. We <span class="lightBlue">went</span> <span class="purple">in the shoe department</span> and we <span class="black">pretended</span> <span class="red">she</span>--<span class="grey">old</span> <span class="blue">Phoebe</span>-- <span class="green">wanted</span> to<span class="lightBlue"> get</span> <span class="middleBlue">a pair</span> of those <span class="middleBlue">very high storm </span><span class="red">shoes</span>, the kind that have <span class="middleBlue">about a million</span> <span class="red">holes</span> to <span class="lightBlue">lace up</span>. We had the <span class="middleBlue">poor</span> <span class="red">salesman guy</span> going <span class="black">crazy</span>.
                           <span class="grey">Old</span> <span class="blue">Phoebe</span> <span class="lightBlue">tried on</span> <span class="middleBlue">about twenty</span> <span class="red">pairs</span>, and <span class="pink">each time</span> the <span class="middleBlue">poor</span> <span class="red">guy</span> had to <span class="lightBlue">lace</span> <span class="middleBlue">one </span><span class="red">shoe</span> <span class="middleBlue">all the way</span> <span class="lightBlue">up</span>. It was a <span class="middleBlue">dirty</span> <span class="red">trick</span>, but it <span class="grey">killed old</span> <span class="blue">Phoebe</span>. We <span class="pink">finally </span><span class="lightGreen">bought</span> <span class="middleBlue">a pair of</span> <span class="red">moccasins</span> and <span class="lightGreen">charged</span> <span class="red">them</span>. The salesman was <span class="middleBlue">very nice</span> about <span class="red">it</span>. 
                           I <span class="green">think</span> he <span class="green">knew</span> we were <span class="grey">horsing around</span>, because <span class="grey">old</span> <span class="blue">Phoebe</span> <span class="pink">always</span> starts giggling. <span class="middleBlue">Anyway</span>, I <span class="green">kept</span> <span class="lightBlue">walking and walking</span> <span class="purple">up Fifth Avenue</span>, without <span class="red">any tie</span> on <span class="grey">or anything.</span> Then <span class="pink">all of a sudden</span>, <span class="red">something</span> <span class="middleBlue">very</span> <span class="grey">spooky</span> started happening. <span class="pink">Every time</span> I <span class="lightBlue">came</span> <span class="purple">to the end of a block</span> and <span class="lightBlue">stepped off</span> the <span class="grey">goddam</span> <span class="red">curb</span>,
                           I had <span class="red">this feeling</span> that I'd <span class="pink">never</span> <span class="lightBlue">get</span> <span class="purple">to the </span><span class="middleBlue">other </span><span class="purple">side of the street</span>. I <span class="green">thought</span> I'd <span class="middleBlue">just</span> <span class="lightBlue">go down</span>, <span class="purple">down, down</span>, and nobody'd <span class="pink">ever</span> see <span class="red">me</span> <span class="pink">again</span>. <span class="grey">Boy,</span> did it <span class="black">scare</span> <span class="red">me</span>. You can't <span class="green">imagine</span>. I started <span class="brown">sweating</span> <span class="grey">like a bastard</span>--my <span class="middleBlue">whole</span> <span class="red">shirt</span> and <span class="red">underwear
                           </span><span class="grey">and everything. </span>Then I started doing <span class="red">something else</span>. <span class="pink">Every time</span> I'd <span class="lightBlue">get</span> <span class="purple">to the end of a block</span> I'd make <span class="green">believe</span> I was talking to my brother <span class="blue">Allie</span>. I'd say to him, "<span class="blue">Allie</span>, don't let <span class="red">me</span> <span class="black">disappear</span>. <span class="blue">Allie</span>, don't let <span class="red">me</span> <span class="black">disappear</span>. <span class="blue">Allie</span>, don't let <span class="red">me</span> <span class="black">disappear</span>. Please, <span class="blue">Allie</span>." And <span class="pink">then when</span> I'd <span class="lightBlue">reach</span> <span class="purple">the other side of the street</span> without <span class="black">disappearing</span>, I'd thank <span class="red">him</span>.
                           Then it would start <span class="middleBlue">all over again</span><span class="pink"> as soon as</span> <span class="lightBlue">I got</span> <span class="purple">to the next corner.</span> But I <span class="lightBlue">kept going</span> <span class="grey">and all.</span> I was <span class="grey">sort of </span><span class="black">afraid</span> to stop, I <span class="green">think</span>--I don't remember, to tell you <span class="red">the truth</span>. I <span class="green">know </span>I didn't stop <span class="pink">till</span> I was <span class="purple">way up in the Sixties, past the zoo</span> <span class="grey">and all</span>. <span class="pink">Then</span> I <span class="lightBlue">sat down</span> <span class="purple">on this bench</span>. I could <span class="middleBlue">hardly</span> get my <span class="orange">breath,</span> and I was <span class="pink">still </span><span class="brown">sweating</span> 
                           <span class="grey">like a bastard.</span> I <span class="green">sat</span> <span class="purple">there</span>, I <span class="green">guess</span>, <span class="pink">for about an hour</span>. <span class="pink">Finally</span>, what I decided I'd do, I decided I'd <span class="lightBlue">go away</span>. I decided I'd <span class="pink">never </span><span class="lightBlue">go</span> <span class="purple">home</span> <span class="pink">again</span> and I'd <span class="pink">never</span> <span class="lightBlue">go away</span> <span class="purple">to</span> <span class="middleBlue">another</span> <span class="purple">school</span> <span class="pink">again</span>. I decided I'd just see <span class="grey">old</span> <span class="blue">Phoebe</span> and <span class="grey">sort of</span> say <span class="red">goodby</span> to her <span class="grey">and all,</span> and <span class="lightBlue">give</span> her <span class="lightBlue">back</span> 
                           her <span class="blue">Christmas </span><span class="lightGreen">dough</span>, and <span class="pink">then</span> I'd <span class="lightBlue">start hitchhiking</span> my way <span class="purple">out West</span>. <span class="red">What</span> I'd do, I <span class="green">figured</span>, I'd <span class="lightBlue">go down</span> <span class="purple">to the Holland Tunnel </span>and <span class="grey">bum</span> <span class="red">a ride</span>, <span class="pink">and then</span> I'd <span class="grey">bum</span> <span class="middleBlue">another</span> <span class="red">one</span>, and <span class="middleBlue">another </span><span class="red">one,</span> and <span class="middleBlue">another</span> <span class="red">one</span>, and <span class="pink">in a few days</span> I'd be <span class="purple">somewhere out West where</span> it was <span class="middleBlue">very pretty and sunny</span> and <span class="purple">where</span> nobody'd<span class="green">
                           know</span> <span class="red">me</span> and I'd get a <span class="red">job</span>. I <span class="green">figured</span> I could get a <span class="red">job</span><span class="purple"> at a filling station somewhere</span>, <span class="lightBlue">putting</span> <span class="red">gas</span> and <span class="red">oil</span> <span class="purple">in people's cars</span>. I didn't care what kind of job it was, though. <span class="middleBlue">Just so</span> people didn't <span class="green">know</span> <span class="red">me</span> and I didn't know <span class="red">anybody</span>. I <span class="green">thought </span><span class="red">what</span> I'd do was, I'd <span class="black">pretend</span> I was <span class="red">one of those</span> <span class="grey">deaf-mutes.</span> That <span class="middleBlue">way</span> I wouldn't have to have <span class="red">any</span> <span class="grey">goddam</span> <span class="black">stupid
                           useless</span> <span class="red">conversations</span> with anybody. If anybody <span class="green">wanted </span>to tell me <span class="red">something</span>, they'd have to <span class="lightBlue">write</span> <span class="red">it </span><span class="purple">on a piece of paper</span> and <span class="grey">shove it over</span> to me. They'd get <span class="black">bored</span> <span class="grey">as hell</span> doing <span class="red">that</span> <span class="pink">after a while</span>, and then I'd be through with having <span class="red">conversations</span> <span class="pink">for the rest of my life</span>. Everybody'd <span class="green">think</span> I was <span class="middleBlue">just </span>a <span class="middleBlue">poor</span> <span class="grey">deaf-mute bastard </span>and they'd leave <span class="red">me </span><span class="middleBlue">alone</span>. They'd let <span class="red">me</span> <span class="lightBlue">put</span><span class="red">gas</span> 
                           and <span class="red">oil</span> <span class="purple">in their </span><span class="black">stupid</span> <span class="purple">cars</span>, and they'd <span class="lightGreen">pay</span> <span class="red">me</span> a <span class="lightGreen">salary</span> <span class="grey">and all </span>for <span class="red">it</span>, and I'd <span class="lightBlue">build</span> me a <span class="middleBlue">little</span> <span class="purple">cabin somewhere</span> with the <span class="lightGreen">dough</span> I made and live <span class="purple">there </span><span class="pink">for the rest of my life</span>. I'd <span class="lightBlue">build</span> it<span class="purple"> right near the woods</span>, but not <span class="purple">right in them</span>, because I'd <span class="green">want</span> <span class="red">it</span> to be <span class="middleBlue">sunny</span> <span class="grey">as hell</span> <span class="pink">all the time</span>. I'd cook <span class="middleBlue">all
                           my own</span> <span class="red">food</span>, and <span class="pink">later on</span>, if I <span class="green">wanted</span> to get married or something, I'd <span class="lightBlue">meet</span> this <span class="middleBlue">beautiful</span> <span class="red">girl</span> that was also a <span class="grey">deaf-mute</span> and we'd get married. She'd come and live <span class="purple">in my cabin</span> with me, and if she <span class="green">wanted </span>to say <span class="red">anything</span> to me, she'd have to <span class="lightBlue">write</span> <span class="red">it</span> <span class="purple">on a</span> <span class="grey">goddam</span> <span class="purple">piece of paper</span>, like <span class="red">everybody else</span>. If we had <span class="red">any children</span>, we'd <span class="black">hide</span> <span class="red">them</span> <span class="purple">somewhere</span>. We could <span class="lightGreen">buy</span> <span class="red">them
                           </span><span class="middleBlue">a lot of</span> <span class="red">books</span> and teach <span class="red">them</span> how to read and<span class="lightBlue"> write </span><span class="middleBlue">by ourselves</span>. I got <span class="middleBlue">excited</span> <span class="grey">as hell</span> <span class="green">thinking</span> about <span class="red">it</span>. I really did. I <span class="green">knew</span> <span class="red">the part</span> about <span class="black">pretending</span> I was a <span class="grey">deaf-mute</span> was <span class="black">crazy</span>, but I liked <span class="green">thinking</span> about<span class="red"> it</span> anyway. But I <span class="middleBlue">really </span>decided <span class="lightBlue">to go</span> <span class="purple">out West</span> <span class="grey">and all</span>. All I <span class="green">wanted</span> to do <span class="pink">first</span> was say <span class="red">good-by</span> 
                           to <span class="grey">old</span> <span class="blue">Phoebe</span>. So <span class="pink">all of a sudden</span>, I<span class="lightBlue"> ran</span> <span class="grey">like a madman</span> <span class="purple">across the street</span>--I <span class="grey">damn</span> near got <span class="black">killed</span> doing <span class="red">it</span>, if you <span class="green">want</span> to <span class="green">know</span> <span class="red">the truth</span>--and <span class="lightBlue">went</span> <span class="purple">in this stationery store</span> and <span class="lightGreen">bought</span> <span class="red">a pad</span> and <span class="red">pencil.</span> I <span class="green">figured</span> I'd <span class="lightBlue">write</span> her <span class="red">a note</span> telling her <span class="purple">where</span> to <span class="lightBlue">meet</span> <span class="red">me</span> so I could say <span class="red">good-by</span> to her and <span class="lightBlue">give</span> her <span class="lightBlue">back</span> her <span class="blue">Christmas</span> <span class="lightGreen">dough</span>,
                           and <span class="pink">then</span> I'd <span class="lightBlue">take</span> <span class="red">the note</span> <span class="purple">up to her school </span>and get <span class="red">somebody</span> <span class="purple">in the principal's office</span> to <span class="lightBlue">give</span> <span class="red">it</span> to her. But I <span class="middleBlue">just</span> <span class="lightBlue">put</span> <span class="red">the pad</span> and <span class="red">pencil</span> <span class="purple">in my pocket</span> and started <span class="lightBlue">walking</span> <span class="middleBlue">fast</span> <span class="grey">as hell</span> <span class="purple">up to her school</span>--I was <span class="middleBlue">too excited </span>to <span class="lightBlue">write</span> <span class="red">the note</span> <span class="middleBlue">right</span> <span class="purple">in the stationery store</span>. I <span class="lightBlue">walked</span> <span class="middleBlue">fast</span> because I 
                           <span class="green">wanted</span> her to get <span class="red">the note</span> <span class="pink">before</span> she <span class="lightBlue">went </span><span class="purple">home </span><span class="pink">for lunch,</span> and I didn't have any <span class="middleBlue">too much</span> <span class="pink">time</span>. I <span class="green">knew </span><span class="purple">where her school was</span>, <span class="middleBlue">naturally</span>, because I <span class="lightBlue">went</span> <span class="purple">there</span> myself <span class="pink">when</span> I was <span class="red">a kid.</span> <span class="pink">When</span> <span class="lightBlue">I got</span> <span class="purple">there</span>, it felt <span class="middleBlue">funny</span>. I wasn't <span class="middleBlue">sure</span> I'd remember <span class="red">what</span> it was like <span class="purple">inside</span>, but I did. It was <span class="middleBlue">exactly the same</span> as it was <span class="pink">when</span><span class="lightBlue">
                           I went</span> <span class="purple">there</span>. They had that <span class="middleBlue">same big</span> <span class="purple">yard inside</span>, that was <span class="pink">always</span> <span class="grey">sort of</span> <span class="middleBlue">dark</span>, with those <span class="red">cages</span> <span class="purple">around the light bulbs</span> so they wouldn't <span class="black">break</span> if they got <span class="black">hit</span> <span class="middleBlue">with a ball</span>. They had those <span class="middleBlue">same white</span> <span class="red">circles</span> <span class="middleBlue">painted</span> <span class="purple">all over the floor</span>, for <span class="red">games</span> <span class="grey">and stuff</span>. And those <span class="middleBlue">same</span> <span class="black">old</span> <span class="red">basketball rings</span> <span class="middleBlue">without</span> <span class="red">any nets</span>- -<span class="middleBlue">just</span> <span class="red">the backboards</span> and <span class="red">the rings</span>. 
                           Nobody was <span class="purple">around</span> <span class="middleBlue">at all, probably</span> because it wasn't <span class="pink">recess period</span>, and it wasn't <span class="pink">lunchtime yet</span>. All I saw was <span class="middleBlue">one little </span><span class="red">kid</span>, a <span class="middleBlue">colored</span> <span class="red">kid</span>, <span class="purple">on his way to the bathroom</span>. He had one of those <span class="middleBlue">wooden</span> <span class="red">passes</span> sticking out of his <span class="middleBlue">hip</span> <span class="red">pocket</span>, the <span class="middleBlue">same way</span> we used to have,<span class="lightBlue"> to show </span>he had <span class="red">permission </span><span class="grey">and all</span> <span class="lightBlue">to go</span> <span class="purple">to the bathroom</span>. I was <span class="pink">still</span> <span class="brown">sweating</span>, but <span class="middleBlue">not so</span> <span class="black">bad</span> 
                           <span class="pink">any more</span>. I <span class="lightBlue">went over</span> <span class="purple">to the stairs</span> and <span class="lightBlue">sat down</span> <span class="purple">on the first step</span> and<span class="lightBlue"> took out </span><span class="red">the pad</span> and <span class="red">pencil</span> I'd <span class="lightGreen">bought</span>. The <span class="red">stairs</span> had the <span class="middleBlue">same </span><span class="red">smell</span> they used to have <span class="pink">when</span> <span class="lightBlue">I went</span> <span class="purple">there</span>. Like somebody'd <span class="pink">just </span><span class="grey">taken a leak</span> <span class="purple">on them. School</span> <span class="red">stairs</span> <span class="pink">always</span> <span class="brown">smell</span> <span class="middleBlue">like that. Anyway</span>, I <span class="green">sat</span> <span class="purple">there</span> and <span class="lightBlue">wrote</span> this 
                           <span class="red">note</span>: <span class="middleBlue">DEAR</span> <span class="blue">PHOEBE</span>, I can't <span class="green">wait around</span> <span class="pink">till Wednesday any more</span> so I will <span class="middleBlue">probably</span> <span class="lightBlue">hitch hike</span> <span class="purple">out west</span> <span class="pink">this afternoon</span>. <span class="lightBlue">Meet</span> <span class="red">me</span> <span class="purple">at the Museum of art near the door</span><span class="pink"> at quarter past 12</span> if you can and I will <span class="lightBlue">give</span> you your <span class="blue">Christmas </span><span class="lightGreen">dough</span> <span class="lightBlue">back</span>. I didn't <span class="lightGreen">spend</span> <span class="middleBlue">much</span>. Love, <span class="blue">HOLDEN </span>Her <span class="purple">school </span>was <span class="middleBlue">practically right</span> <span class="purple">near the museum</span>, and she had to <span class="lightBlue">pass</span> <span class="red">it</span> <span class="purple">on her way home</span> <span class="pink">for lunch</span> <span class="middleBlue">anyway</span>, 
                           so I <span class="green">knew </span>she could <span class="lightBlue">meet</span> <span class="red">me</span> <span class="middleBlue">all right</span>. Then I started <span class="lightBlue">walking</span> <span class="purple">up the stairs to the principal's office</span> so I could <span class="lightBlue">give</span> <span class="red">the note</span> to somebody that would <span class="lightBlue">bring</span> <span class="red">it</span> to her<span class="purple"> in her classroom</span>. I <span class="lightBlue">folded </span><span class="red">it</span> <span class="pink">about ten times</span> so nobody'd <span class="lightBlue">open</span> <span class="red">it</span>. You can't trust <span class="red">anybody</span> in a <span class="grey">goddam</span> <span class="purple">school</span>. But I <span class="green">knew</span> they'd <span class="lightBlue">give</span> <span class="red">it</span> to her if I was her <span class="red">brother </span><span class="grey">and all.</span> <span class="pink">While</span> I was <span class="lightBlue">walking</span> <span class="purple">up the stairs</span>, though, <span class="pink">all of a sudden</span>
                           I <span class="green">thought</span> I was going to <span class="black">puke</span> <span class="pink">again</span>. <span class="middleBlue">Only</span>, I didn't. I <span class="green">sat down</span> <span class="pink">for a second</span>, and then <span class="brown">I felt better.</span> But <span class="pink">while</span> I was <span class="green">sitting down</span>, I saw <span class="red">something</span> that drove <span class="red">me </span><span class="black">crazy</span>. Somebody'd <span class="lightBlue">written </span><span class="grey">"Fuck you</span>" <span class="purple">on the wall</span>. It drove <span class="red">me </span><span class="grey">damn</span> near <span class="black">crazy</span>. I <span class="green">thought</span> <span class="middleBlue">how</span> <span class="blue">Phoebe</span> and all the <span class="middleBlue">other little</span> <span class="red">kids</span> would see <span class="red">it</span>, and how they'd <span class="green">wonder</span> <span class="grey">what the hell</span> <span class="red">it</span> meant, and then <span class="pink">finally</span> some <span class="grey">dirty </span><span class="red">kid 
                           </span>would tell <span class="red">them</span>--all <span class="grey">cockeyed,</span> <span class="middleBlue">naturally</span>--<span class="red">what it</span> meant, and <span class="middleBlue">how</span> they'd all <span class="green">think</span> about <span class="red">it</span> and maybe even <span class="black">worry</span> <span class="red">about it</span> <span class="pink">for a couple of days</span>. I <span class="green">kept wanting</span> to <span class="black">kill</span> whoever'd <span class="lightBlue">written </span><span class="red">it</span>. I <span class="green">figured</span> it was some <span class="grey">perverty bum</span> that'd <span class="lightBlue">sneaked</span> <span class="purple">in the school </span><span class="pink">late at night</span> to <span class="grey">take a leak or something </span>and <span class="pink">then</span> <span class="lightBlue">wrote</span> <span class="red">it</span> <span class="purple">on the wall</span>. I kept <span class="green">picturing</span> <span class="red">myself </span><span class="lightBlue">catching</span> him at it, and <span class="middleBlue">how</span> I'd <span class="black">smash
                           </span>his <span class="orange">head</span> <span class="purple">on the stone steps</span> <span class="pink">till </span>he was <span class="middleBlue">good</span> and <span class="grey">goddam</span> <span class="black">dead</span> and <span class="black">bloody.</span> But I <span class="green">knew</span>, too, I wouldn't have <span class="grey">the guts</span> to do it. I <span class="green">knew</span> <span class="red">that</span>. That made <span class="red">me</span> <span class="middleBlue">even more</span> <span class="black">depressed</span>. I <span class="middleBlue">hardly even</span> had <span class="grey">the guts</span> <span class="lightBlue">to rub</span> <span class="red">it</span> <span class="lightBlue">off</span> <span class="purple">the wall</span> <span class="middleBlue">with my hand</span>, if you <span class="green">want</span> to<span class="green"> know</span> <span class="red">the truth</span>. I was <span class="black">afraid</span> some teacher would <span class="lightBlue">catch</span> <span class="red">me</span> <span class="lightBlue">rubbing</span> <span class="red">it</span> <span class="lightBlue">off 
                           </span>and would <span class="green">think </span>I'd <span class="lightBlue">written</span> <span class="red">it</span>. But I <span class="lightBlue">rubbed</span> <span class="red">it</span> <span class="lightBlue">out </span><span class="middleBlue">anyway</span>, <span class="pink">finally</span>. <span class="pink">Then</span> I <span class="lightBlue">went on</span> <span class="purple">up to the principal's office</span>. The principal didn't seem to be <span class="purple">around</span>, but some <span class="black">old</span><span class="red"> lady</span> <span class="middleBlue">around</span> <span class="pink">a hundred years</span> <span class="black">old </span>was <span class="green">sitting</span> <span class="purple">at a typewriter</span>. I told her I was <span class="blue">Phoebe Caulfield</span>'s brother, <span class="purple">in 4B-1</span>, and I asked her to please <span class="lightBlue">give</span> <span class="blue">Phoebe </span><span class="red">the note.</span> I said it was <span class="middleBlue">very 
                           important</span> because my mother was <span class="black">sick</span> and wouldn't have <span class="red">lunch </span><span class="middleBlue">ready</span> for <span class="blue">Phoebe</span> and that she'd have to <span class="lightBlue">meet</span> <span class="red">me</span> and have <span class="red">lunch</span> <span class="purple">in a drugstore</span>. She was <span class="middleBlue">very nice</span> about it, the <span class="black">old</span> lady. She <span class="lightBlue">took</span> <span class="red">the note</span> <span class="lightBlue">off</span> me and called <span class="middleBlue">some other</span> <span class="red">lady</span>, <span class="purple">from the next office</span>, and the <span class="middleBlue">other</span> lady <span class="lightBlue">went to give </span><span class="red">it</span> to <span class="blue">Phoebe</span>. Then the <span class="black">old</span> <span class="red">lady</span> that was <span class="middleBlue">around</span> <span class="pink">a hundred years</span> <span class="black">old</span> and I <span class="grey">shot the breeze</span> <span class="pink">for a while</span>, She was <span class="middleBlue">pretty nice</span>, 
                           and I told her <span class="middleBlue">how </span>I<span class="lightBlue">'d gone</span> <span class="purple">there to school</span>, <span class="middleBlue">too</span>, and my brothers. She asked <span class="red">me</span> <span class="purple">where</span> <span class="lightBlue">I went</span> <span class="purple">to school</span> <span class="pink">now</span>, and I told her <span class="blue">Pencey</span>, and she said <span class="blue">Pencey</span> was a <span class="middleBlue">very good</span> <span class="purple">school</span>. <span class="middleBlue">Even</span> if I'd <span class="green">wanted </span>to, I wouldn't have had <span class="red">the strength</span> to <span class="grey">straighten her out.</span> Besides, if she <span class="green">thought</span> <span class="blue">Pencey</span> was a <span class="middleBlue">very good</span> <span class="purple">school</span>, let her <span class="green">think</span> <span class="red">it</span>. You <span class="black">hate</span> to tell <span class="middleBlue">new</span> <span class="grey">stuff</span> to somebody <span class="middleBlue">around</span>
                           <span class="pink">a hundred years</span> <span class="black">old.</span> They don't like to hear <span class="red">it</span>. <span class="pink">Then, after a while</span>,<span class="lightBlue"> I left</span>. It was <span class="middleBlue">funny</span>. She yelled <span class="red">"Good luck!"</span> at me <span class="middleBlue">the same way</span> <span class="grey">old</span> <span class="blue">Spencer </span>did<span class="pink"> when</span> <span class="lightBlue">I left</span> <span class="blue">Pencey</span>. <span class="grey">God, </span><span class="middleBlue">how</span> I <span class="black">hate</span> <span class="red">it </span><span class="pink">when</span> somebody yells <span class="red">"Good luck!"</span> at me <span class="pink">when</span> <span class="lightBlue">I'm leaving</span> <span class="purple">somewhere</span>. It's <span class="black">depressing</span>. I<span class="lightBlue"> went down</span> <span class="purple">by a</span> <span class="middleBlue">different</span>
                           <span class="purple">staircase</span>, and I saw<span class="middleBlue"> another</span> "<span class="grey">Fuck you</span>" <span class="purple">on the wall</span>. I tried to <span class="lightBlue">rub</span> <span class="red">it</span> <span class="lightBlue">off</span> <span class="middleBlue">with my hand</span> <span class="pink">again</span>, but this one was <span class="middleBlue">scratched on, with a knife</span> <span class="grey">or something. </span>It wouldn't <span class="lightBlue">come off</span>. It's <span class="black">hopeless</span>, <span class="middleBlue">anyway</span>. If you had <span class="pink">a million years</span> to do <span class="red">it</span> in, you couldn't <span class="lightBlue">rub out</span> <span class="middleBlue">even half</span> the "<span class="grey">Fuck you"</span> <span class="red">signs</span> <span class="purple">in the world</span>. It's <span class="middleBlue">impossible</span>. I looked at <span class="red">the clock</span> <span class="purple">in the recess yard</span>, and it was <span class="middleBlue">only</span> <span class="pink">twenty 
                           to twelve</span>, so I had <span class="middleBlue">quite a lot of</span> <span class="grey">time to kill</span> <span class="pink">before </span>I<span class="lightBlue"> met</span> <span class="grey">old </span><span class="blue">Phoebe</span>. But I <span class="middleBlue">just</span> <span class="lightBlue">walked over</span> <span class="purple">to the museum</span> <span class="middleBlue">anyway</span>. There wasn't <span class="purple">anyplace else</span> <span class="lightBlue">to go</span>. I <span class="green">thought</span> <span class="middleBlue">maybe</span> I might stop <span class="purple">in a phone booth</span> and <span class="lightBlue">give</span> <span class="grey">old</span> <span class="blue">Jane Gallagher</span> <span class="grey">a buzz</span> <span class="pink">before</span> I started <span class="grey">bumming</span> <span class="middleBlue">my way</span> <span class="purple">west</span>, but I wasn't <span class="grey">in the mood. For one thing,</span> I wasn't <span class="middleBlue">even sure</span> she was <span class="purple">home</span> <span class="pink">for vacation yet</span>. So I <span class="middleBlue">just
                           </span><span class="lightBlue">went over</span> <span class="purple">to the museum</span>, and <span class="grey">hung around.</span> <span class="pink">While</span> I was <span class="green">waiting around</span> for <span class="blue">Phoebe</span> <span class="purple">in the museum</span>, <span class="middleBlue">right</span> <span class="purple">inside the doors</span><span class="grey"> and all</span>, these <span class="middleBlue">two little</span> <span class="red">kids</span> <span class="lightBlue">came up</span> to me and asked me if I <span class="green">knew</span> <span class="purple">where</span> <span class="red">the mummies</span> were. The one <span class="middleBlue">little </span><span class="red">kid</span>, the one that asked me, had his <span class="red">pants</span> <span class="middleBlue">open</span>. I told him about <span class="red">it</span>. So he <span class="lightBlue">buttoned</span> <span class="red">them</span> <span class="lightBlue">up</span> <span class="middleBlue">right</span> <span class="purple">where</span>
                           he was <span class="green">standing</span> talking to me--he didn't <span class="middleBlue">even</span> bother<span class="lightBlue"> to go</span> <span class="purple">behind a post </span><span class="grey">or anything</span>. He <span class="grey">killed</span> <span class="red">me</span>. I would've laughed, but I was <span class="black">afraid</span> I'd <span class="grey">feel like</span> <span class="black">vomiting</span> <span class="pink">again</span>, so I didn't. "<span class="purple">Where're</span> <span class="red">the mummies</span>, <span class="grey">fella</span>?" the kid said <span class="pink">again</span>. <span class="grey">"Ya</span> <span class="green">know</span>?" I <span class="grey">horsed around</span> with the two of them <span class="middleBlue">a little bit</span>. "The mummies? <span class="red">What're they</span>?" I asked the one kid. "You <span class="green">know</span>. The mummies--them <span class="black">dead</span> <span class="red">guys</span>. That get <span class="black">buried</span> <span class="grey">in them toons and all." Toons.</span> That <span class="grey">killed</span>
                           <span class="red">me</span>. He meant <span class="red">tombs</span>. "<span class="grey">How come</span> you two guys aren't <span class="purple">in school</span>?" I said. "No school <span class="grey">t'day,"</span> the kid that did <span class="red">all the talking</span> said. He was <span class="black">lying</span>,<span class="grey"> sure as I'm alive,</span> the <span class="middleBlue">little</span> <span class="grey">bastard.</span> I didn't have <span class="red">anything</span> to do, though, <span class="pink">till </span><span class="grey">old <span class="blue">Phoebe</span> <span class="lightBlue">showed up</span>, so I helped <span class="red">them</span> find <span class="purple">the place where</span> <span class="red">the mummies</span> were. <span class="grey">Boy,</span> I used to <span class="green">know</span> <span class="middleBlue">exactly</span> <span class="purple">where</span> they were, but I hadn't been <span class="purple">in that museum</span> <span class="pink">in years</span>. "You two guys so <span class="middleBlue">interested</span> in mummies?" I said. "<span class="grey">Yeah." </span>"Can't your friend talk?" I said. 
                           "He <span class="grey">ain't </span>my friend. He's my <span class="grey">brudda."</span> "Can't he talk?" I looked at the one that wasn't doing <span class="red">any talking</span>. "Can't you talk<span class="middleBlue"> at all</span>?" I asked him. "<span class="grey">Yeah,"</span> he said. "I don't <span class="grey">feel like it.</span>" <span class="pink">Finally</span> we found <span class="purple">the place where</span> <span class="red">the mummies</span> were, and we <span class="lightBlue">went in</span>. "You <span class="green">know </span>how the <span class="blue">Egyptians</span> <span class="black">buried</span> their <span class="black">dead</span>?" I asked the one kid. "<span class="grey">Naa." "Well,</span> you should. It's very <span class="middleBlue">interesting</span>. They <span class="lightBlue">wrapped </span>their <span class="orange">faces</span> <span class="lightBlue">up</span> <span class="purple">in these cloths</span> that were treated with some <span class="middleBlue">secret</span> <span class="red">chemical</span>. That way they could be <span class="black">buried</span> 
                           <span class="purple">in their tombs</span> <span class="pink">for thousands of years</span> and their <span class="orange">faces</span> wouldn't <span class="black">rot</span> <span class="grey">or anything. </span>Nobody <span class="green">knows</span> how to do<span class="red"> it</span> except the <span class="blue">Egyptians</span>. Even <span class="middleBlue">modern</span> <span class="red">science</span>." To <span class="lightBlue">get</span> to <span class="purple">where</span> <span class="red">the mummies</span> were, you had <span class="lightBlue">to go down</span> this <span class="middleBlue">very narrow</span> <span class="grey">sort of </span><span class="purple">hall</span> <span class="middleBlue">with stones</span> <span class="purple">on the side </span>that they'd <span class="lightBlue">taken</span> <span class="middleBlue">right </span><span class="lightBlue">out</span> of this <span class="blue">Pharaoh's</span> <span class="purple">tomb</span> <span class="grey">and all.</span> It was <span class="middleBlue">pretty</span> <span class="grey">spooky,</span> and you could tell the e <span class="middleBlue">two</span> <span class="grey">hot-shots</span> 
                           I was with weren't enjoying <span class="red">it</span> <span class="middleBlue">too much</span>. They stuck <span class="middleBlue">close</span> <span class="grey">as hell </span>to me, and the one that didn't talk <span class="middleBlue">at all practically</span> was <span class="green">holding</span> <span class="purple">onto my sleeve</span>. "Let's <span class="lightBlue">go</span>," he said to his brother. "I seen <span class="grey">'em awreddy. C'mon, hey.</span>" He <span class="lightBlue">turned around</span> and <span class="grey">beat it.</span> "He's got a <span class="grey">yella streak</span> <span class="middleBlue">a mile wide</span>," the <span class="middleBlue">other</span> one said. <span class="grey">"So long!" </span>He <span class="grey">beat it </span>too. I was <span class="middleBlue">the only one left</span> <span class="purple">in the tomb</span> then. I <span class="grey">sort of </span>liked it, <span class="middleBlue">in a way</span>. It was <span class="middleBlue">so nice and peaceful</span>. Then, <span class="pink">all of a sudden</span>, you'd <span class="pink">never </span><span class="green">guess</span> <span class="red">what</span> 
                           I saw <span class="purple">on the wall.</span> <span class="middleBlue">Another</span> "<span class="grey">Fuck you."</span> It was <span class="lightBlue">written</span> <span class="middleBlue">with a red crayon</span> <span class="grey">or something,</span> <span class="middleBlue">right</span> <span class="purple">under the glass part of the wall, under the stones</span>. That's the <span class="middleBlue">whole</span> trouble. You can't <span class="pink">ever</span> find <span class="purple">a place</span> that's <span class="middleBlue">nice and peaceful</span>, because there isn't <span class="red">any</span>. You may <span class="green">think</span> there is, but <span class="pink">once</span> you <span class="lightBlue">get</span> <span class="purple">there</span>, <span class="pink">when</span> you're not looking, somebody'll <span class="lightBlue">sneak up</span> and <span class="lightBlue">write</span> <span class="grey">"Fuck you"</span> <span class="middleBlue">right</span> <span class="purple">under your nose</span>. Try <span class="red">it</span> <span class="pink">sometime</span>. I <span class="green">think</span>, <span class="middleBlue">even</span>,
                           if I <span class="pink">ever </span><span class="black">die</span>, and they stick <span class="red">me</span> <span class="purple">in a cemetery</span>, and I have <span class="red">a tombstone </span><span class="grey">and all</span>, it'll say "<span class="blue">Holden Caulfield</span>" <span class="purple">on it</span>, and then what <span class="pink">year</span> I was born and <span class="red">what</span> <span class="pink">year</span> I <span class="black">died</span>, and then <span class="middleBlue">right</span> <span class="purple">under that</span> it'll say "<span class="grey">Fuck you."</span> I'm <span class="middleBlue">positive</span>, in fact. <span class="pink">After</span> I <span class="lightBlue">came out </span>of <span class="purple">the place where</span> <span class="red">the mummies</span> were, I had <span class="lightBlue">to go</span> <span class="purple">to the bathroom</span>. I <span class="grey">sort of</span> had <span class="black">diarrhea</span>, if you <span class="green">want </span>to <span class="green">know</span> <span class="red">the truth</span>. I didn't mind the <span class="black">diarrhea</span> part<span class="middleBlue"> 
                           too much</span>, but <span class="red">something else</span> happened. <span class="pink">When </span>I was <span class="lightBlue">coming out</span> of <span class="grey">the can</span>, <span class="pink">right before</span> I <span class="lightBlue">got</span> <span class="purple">to the door</span>, I <span class="grey">sort of </span><span class="black">passed out</span>. I was <span class="middleBlue">lucky</span>, though. I mean I could've <span class="black">killed</span> <span class="red">myself</span> <span class="pink">when</span> I <span class="grey">hit the floor,</span> but all I did was <span class="grey">sort of</span> <span class="lightBlue">land</span> <span class="middleBlue">on my side</span>. it was a <span class="middleBlue">funny</span> <span class="red">thing</span>, though. I <span class="brown">felt better</span> <span class="pink">after</span> I <span class="black">passed out.</span> I <span class="middleBlue">really</span> did. My <span class="orange">arm</span> <span class="grey">sort of</span> <span class="black">hurt</span>, from <span class="purple">where</span><span class="lightBlue"> I fell</span>, but I didn't feel so <span class="grey">damn</span> 
                           <span class="black">dizzy </span><span class="pink">any more</span>. It was <span class="middleBlue">about</span> <span class="pink">ten after twelve</span> <span class="grey">or so then</span>, and so <span class="lightBlue">I went back</span> and <span class="green">stood</span> <span class="purple">by the door</span> and <span class="green">waited</span> for <span class="grey">old</span> <span class="blue">Phoebe</span>. I <span class="green">thought</span> how it might be <span class="pink">the last time</span> I'd <span class="pink">ever </span>see <span class="red">her </span><span class="pink">again</span>. Any of <span class="red">my relatives</span>, I mean. I <span class="green">figured</span> I'd <span class="middleBlue">probably</span> see <span class="red">them</span> <span class="pink">again</span>, but not <span class="pink">for years</span>. I might <span class="lightBlue">come</span> <span class="purple">home</span> <span class="pink">when</span> I was <span class="middleBlue">about</span> thirty-five. I <span class="green">figured</span>, in case somebody got <span class="black">sick</span> and <span class="green">wanted </span>to see <span class="red">me</span> 
                           <span class="pink">before</span> they <span class="black">died</span>, but that would be the <span class="middleBlue">only</span> <span class="red">reason</span> I'd <span class="lightBlue">leave</span> my <span class="purple">cabin</span> and <span class="lightBlue">come back</span>. I <span class="middleBlue">even</span> started <span class="green">picturing </span><span class="middleBlue">how</span> it would be <span class="pink">when</span> I <span class="lightBlue">came back</span>. I <span class="green">knew</span> my mother'd get <span class="black">nervous</span> <span class="grey">as hell </span>and start to <span class="black">cry</span> and beg <span class="red">me</span> to <span class="green">stay</span> <span class="purple">home</span> and not <span class="lightBlue">go back</span> to my <span class="purple">cabin</span>, but I'd <span class="lightBlue">go</span> <span class="middleBlue">anyway</span>. I'd be <span class="middleBlue">casual</span> <span class="grey">as hell.</span> I'd make <span class="red">her</span> <span class="middleBlue">calm down</span>, and <span class="pink">then</span> I'd <span class="lightBlue">go over</span> <span class="purple">to the other 
                           side</span> of the <span class="purple">living room</span> and <span class="lightBlue">take out</span> this <span class="red">cigarette case</span> and light a <span class="red">cigarette</span>, <span class="middleBlue">cool </span><span class="grey">as all hell.</span> I'd ask <span class="red">them</span> <span class="middleBlue">all </span><span class="lightBlue">to visit</span> <span class="red">me</span> <span class="pink">sometime</span> if they <span class="green">wanted</span> to, but I wouldn't insist<span class="grey"> or anything. </span><span class="red">What</span> I'd do, I'd let <span class="grey">old</span> <span class="blue">Phoebe </span><span class="lightBlue">come out</span> and <span class="lightBlue">visit</span> <span class="red">me</span> <span class="pink">in the summertime and on Christmas vacation and Easter vacation</span>. And I'd let <span class="blue">D.B.</span> <span class="lightBlue">come out</span> and <span class="lightBlue">visit</span> <span class="red">me</span> for a while if he <span class="green">wanted</span> a <span class="middleBlue">nice, quiet</span> <span class="purple">place</span> for <span class="red">his writing</span>, 
                           but he couldn't <span class="lightBlue">write </span><span class="red">any movies</span><span class="purple"> in my cabin</span>, <span class="middleBlue">only</span> <span class="red">stories</span> and <span class="red">books</span>. I'd have this <span class="red">rule</span> that nobody could do <span class="red">anything</span> <span class="black">phony </span><span class="pink">when </span>they <span class="lightBlue">visited</span> <span class="red">me</span>. If anybody tried to do <span class="red">anything</span> <span class="black">phony</span>, they couldn't <span class="green">stay</span>. <span class="pink">All of a sudden</span> I looked at <span class="red">the clock</span> <span class="purple">in the checkroom </span>and it was <span class="pink">twenty-five of one</span>. I began to get <span class="black">scared</span> that <span class="middleBlue">maybe</span> that <span class="black">old</span> <span class="red">lady</span> <span class="purple">in the school </span>had told that <span class="middleBlue">other</span> <span class="red">lady</span> not to <span class="lightBlue">give</span> <span class="grey">old</span> <span class="blue">Phoebe</span> my 
                           <span class="red">message</span>. I began to get <span class="black">scared</span> that <span class="middleBlue">maybe</span> she'd told her to <span class="black">burn</span> <span class="red">it</span> <span class="grey">or something</span>. It <span class="middleBlue">really</span> <span class="black">scared</span> <span class="grey">hell out of me</span>. I <span class="middleBlue">really </span><span class="green">wanted</span> to see <span class="grey">old</span> <span class="blue">Phoebe</span> <span class="pink">before</span> I <span class="grey">hit the road.</span> I mean I had her <span class="blue">Christmas</span> <span class="lightGreen">dough</span> <span class="grey">and all.</span> <span class="pink">Finally</span>, I saw <span class="red">her</span>. I saw <span class="red">her</span> <span class="middleBlue">through the glass part of the door</span>. The reason I saw <span class="red">her</span>, she had my <span class="black">crazy </span><span class="middleBlue">hunting</span> <span class="red">hat</span> on--you could see <span class="red">that hat</span> <span class="purple">about ten miles away</span>. <span class="lightBlue">I went out</span> 
                           <span class="purple">the doors</span> and <span class="lightBlue">started down</span> these <span class="purple">stone stairs </span>to <span class="lightBlue">meet</span> <span class="red">her</span>. The thing I couldn't <span class="green">understand</span>, she had this <span class="middleBlue">big</span> <span class="red">suitcase </span>with her. She was <span class="middleBlue">just</span> <span class="lightBlue">coming</span> <span class="purple">across Fifth Avenue,</span> and she was <span class="lightBlue">dragging</span> this <span class="grey">goddam</span> <span class="middleBlue">big</span> <span class="red">suitcase</span> with her. She could <span class="middleBlue">hardly</span> <span class="lightBlue">drag</span> <span class="red">it</span>. <span class="pink">When</span> I <span class="lightBlue">got up</span> <span class="middleBlue">closer</span>, I saw <span class="red">it</span> was my <span class="middleBlue">old </span><span class="red">suitcase</span>, the one I used to use <span class="pink">when</span> I was <span class="purple">at Whooton</span>. I couldn't <span class="green">figure out</span> <span class="grey">what the hell </span>she was doing with it. 
                           "Hi," she said <span class="pink">when</span> she <span class="lightBlue">got up</span> <span class="purple">close</span>. She was all <span class="black">out of breath</span> from that <span class="black">crazy</span> <span class="red">suitcase</span>. "I <span class="green">thought</span> <span class="middleBlue">maybe</span> you weren't <span class="lightBlue">coming</span>," I said. "<span class="grey">What the hell's</span> <span class="purple">in that bag</span>? I don't need <span class="red">anything</span>. I'm<span class="middleBlue"> just</span> <span class="lightBlue">going</span> <span class="middleBlue">the way</span> I am. I'm not <span class="middleBlue">even</span> <span class="lightBlue">taking</span> <span class="red">the bags</span> <span class="lightBlue">I got</span> <span class="purple">at the station</span>. <span class="red">What</span> the <span class="grey">hellya</span> got <span class="purple">in there</span>?" She <span class="lightBlue">put</span> <span class="red">the suitcase</span> <span class="lightBlue">down</span>. "My clothes," she said. "I'm <span class="lightBlue">going </span>with you. Can I? Okay?" "<span class="red">What</span>?" I said. 
                           I <span class="middleBlue">almost</span> <span class="lightBlue">fell over</span> <span class="pink">when</span>she said <span class="red">that</span>. I <span class="grey">swear to God I did. I got<span class="grey"> sort of</span> <span class="black">dizzy</span> and I <span class="green">thought</span> I was going to <span class="black">pass out</span> <span class="grey">or something</span> <span class="pink">again</span>. "I <span class="lightBlue">took</span> <span class="red">them</span> <span class="purple">down the back elevator</span> so <span class="blue">Charlene</span> wouldn't see <span class="red">me</span>. It isn't <span class="middleBlue">heavy</span>. All I have<span class="purple"> in it</span> is <span class="middleBlue">two</span> <span class="red">dresses </span>and my <span class="red">moccasins</span> and my <span class="red">underwear</span> and <span class="red">socks</span> and <span class="middleBlue">some other</span> <span class="red">things.</span> Feel <span class="red">it</span>. It isn't <span class="middleBlue">heavy</span>. 
                           Feel <span class="red">it</span> <span class="pink">once</span>. . . Can't I <span class="lightBlue">go</span> with you? <span class="blue">Holden</span>? Can't I? Please." "No. <span class="grey">Shut up</span>." I <span class="green">thought</span> I was going to <span class="black">pass out cold</span>. I mean I didn't mean to tell her to <span class="grey">shut up and all,</span> but I <span class="green">thought</span> I was going to <span class="black">pass out</span> <span class="pink">again</span>. "Why can't I? Please, <span class="blue">Holden</span>! I won't do <span class="red">anything</span>-- I'll <span class="middleBlue">just</span> <span class="lightBlue">go</span> with you, that's <span class="red">all</span>! I won't even <span class="lightBlue">take</span> <span class="red">my clothes</span> with me if you don't <span class="green">want</span> me to--I'll <span class="middleBlue">just</span> <span class="lightBlue">take</span> my--" "You can't <span class="lightBlue">take</span> <span class="red">anything</span>. Because you're not <span class="lightBlue">going</span>. I'm <span class="lightBlue">going</span> <span class="middleBlue">alone</span>. So <span class="grey">shut up."</span> "Please, <span class="blue">Holden</span>. 
                           Please let me <span class="lightBlue">go</span>. I'll be <span class="middleBlue">very, very, very</span>--You won't <span class="middleBlue">even</span>--" "You're not <span class="lightBlue">going</span>. <span class="pink">Now</span>, <span class="grey">shut up! Gimme</span> that <span class="red">bag,</span>" I said. I <span class="lightBlue">took</span> <span class="red">the bag</span> <span class="purple">off her</span>. I was <span class="middleBlue">almost all set</span> to hit <span class="red">her</span>, I <span class="green">thought</span> I was going to <span class="black">smack</span> <span class="red">her</span> <span class="pink">for a second</span>. I really did. She started to <span class="black">cry</span>. "I <span class="green">thought</span> you were supposed to be <span class="purple">in a play at school</span> <span class="grey">and all</span> I <span class="green">thought</span> you were supposed to be <span class="blue">Benedict Arnold</span><span class="purple"> in that play</span> <span class="grey">and all,</span>" I said. I said <span class="red">it</span> <span class="middleBlue">very</span> <span class="black">nasty</span>. "<span class="grey">Whuddaya</span> <span class="green">want</span> to do? Not be <span class="purple">in the play</span>,
                           <span class="grey">for God's sake</span>?" That made her <span class="black">cry</span> <span class="middleBlue">even harder</span>. I was <span class="middleBlue">glad</span>. <span class="pink">All of a sudden</span> I <span class="green">wanted</span> her to <span class="black">cry</span> <span class="pink">till</span> her <span class="orange">eyes </span><span class="middleBlue">practically</span> <span class="black">dropped out</span>. I <span class="middleBlue">almost</span> <span class="black">hated</span> <span class="red">her</span>. I <span class="green">think</span> I <span class="black">hated</span> <span class="red">her</span> most because she wouldn't be <span class="purple">in that play</span> <span class="pink">any more</span> if she <span class="lightBlue">went away</span> with me. "Come on," I said. I <span class="lightBlue">started up</span><span class="red"> the steps</span> <span class="purple">to the museum</span><span class="pink"> again</span>. I <span class="green">figured</span> <span class="red">what</span> I'd do was, I'd check the <span class="black">crazy</span> <span class="red">suitcase</span> she'd <span class="lightBlue">brought</span> <span class="purple">in the checkroom</span>, <span class="grey">andy</span> then she could <span class="lightBlue">get</span>
                           <span class="red">it</span> <span class="pink">again at three o'clock, after school</span>. I <span class="green">knew</span> she couldn't<span class="lightBlue"> take</span> <span class="red">it</span> <span class="purple">back to school</span> with her. "Come on, <span class="pink">now</span>," I said. She didn't <span class="lightBlue">go up</span> <span class="red">the steps</span> with me, though. She wouldn't <span class="lightBlue">come</span> with me. I <span class="lightBlue">went up</span> <span class="middleBlue">anyway</span>, though, and <span class="lightBlue">brought</span> <span class="red">the bag</span> <span class="purple">in the checkroom</span> and checked <span class="red">it</span>, and <span class="pink">then</span> I <span class="lightBlue">came down</span> <span class="pink">again</span>. She was <span class="pink">still</span> <span class="green">standing</span> <span class="purple">there on the sidewalk</span>, but she <span class="lightBlue">turned</span> her <span class="orange">back</span> on me <span class="pink">when</span> I <span class="lightBlue">came up</span> to her. She can do <span class="red">that</span>. She can <span class="lightBlue">turn</span> her <span class="orange">back</span> on you <span class="pink">when </span>she <span class="grey">feels like</span> it.
                           "I'm not <span class="lightBlue">going away</span> <span class="purple">anywhere</span>. I <span class="grey">changed my mind</span>. So stop <span class="black">crying</span>, and <span class="grey">shut up,</span>" I said. The <span class="middleBlue">funny</span> part was, she wasn't even <span class="black">crying</span> <span class="pink">when</span> I said <span class="red">that</span>. I said <span class="red">it</span> <span class="middleBlue">anyway</span>, though, "<span class="grey">C'mon</span>, <span class="pink">now</span>. I'll <span class="lightBlue">walk</span> you <span class="lightBlue">back</span><span class="purple"> to school</span>. <span class="grey">C'mon,</span> <span class="pink">now</span>. You'll be <span class="pink">late</span>." She wouldn't answer me <span class="grey">or anything.</span> I <span class="grey">sort of</span> tried <span class="grey">to get hold of </span>her <span class="grey">old</span> <span class="orange">hand</span>, but she wouldn't let me. She kept <span class="lightBlue">turning around </span>on me. "<span class="grey">Didja</span> have your <span class="red">lunch</span>? <span class="grey">Ya</span> had your <span class="red">lunch</span> <span class="pink">yet</span>?" I asked her. She wouldn't answer me. All she did was, she <span class="lightBlue">took off</span> 
                           my <span class="middleBlue">red hunting</span> <span class="red">hat</span>--the one I <span class="lightBlue">gave</span> her--and <span class="middleBlue">practically</span> <span class="grey">chucked</span> <span class="red">it</span> <span class="middleBlue">right</span> <span class="purple">in my face</span>. <span class="pink">Then</span> she <span class="lightBlue">turned </span>her <span class="orange">back</span> on me <span class="pink">again</span>. It <span class="middleBlue">nearly</span> <span class="grey">killed </span>me, but I didn't say <span class="red">anything</span>. I just <span class="lightBlue">picked<span class="red"> it </span><span class="lightBlue">up</span> and stuck it <span class="purple">in my coat pocket</span>. "Come on, <span class="grey">hey.</span> I'll <span class="lightBlue">walk</span> you <span class="lightBlue">back </span><span class="purple">to school</span>," I said. "I'm not <span class="lightBlue">going back</span> <span class="purple">to school</span>." I didn't <span class="green">know</span> <span class="red">what</span> to say <span class="pink">when</span> she said <span class="red">that</span>. I just <span class="green">stood</span> <span class="purple">there</span> <span class="pink">for a couple of minutes</span>. "You have <span class="lightBlue">
                           to go back</span><span class="purple"> to school</span>. You <span class="green">want</span> to be<span class="purple"> in that play</span>, don't you? You <span class="green">want</span> to be <span class="blue">Benedict Arnold,</span> don't you?" "No." "Sure you do. <span class="middleBlue">Certainly</span> you do. <span class="grey">C'mon,</span> <span class="pink">now</span>, let's <span class="lightBlue">go</span>," I said. "<span class="middleBlue">In the first place</span>, I'm not <span class="lightBlue">going away</span> <span class="purple">anywhere</span>, I told you. I'm <span class="lightBlue">going</span> <span class="purple">home</span>. I'm <span class="lightBlue">going</span> <span class="purple">home</span> <span class="pink">as soon as</span> you <span class="lightBlue">go back</span> <span class="purple">to school</span>. <span class="pink">First</span> I'm <span class="grey">gonna </span><span class="lightBlue">go down</span> <span class="purple">to the station</span> and <span class="lightBlue">get</span> my <span class="red">bags</span>, and <span class="pink">then</span> I'm <span class="grey">gonna</span> <span class="lightBlue">go</span> <span class="middleBlue">straight</span>--" "I said I'm not <span class="lightBlue">going back</span> <span class="purple">to school.</span>
                           You can do <span class="red">what</span> you <span class="green">want </span>to do, but I'm not <span class="lightBlue">going back</span> <span class="purple">to school</span>," she said. "So <span class="grey">shut up</span>." It was <span class="pink">the first time</span> she <span class="pink">ever</span> told me to <span class="grey">shut up.</span> It sounded <span class="black">terrible</span>. <span class="grey">God, </span>it sounded <span class="black">terrible</span>. It sounded <span class="black">worse</span> than <span class="black">swearing</span>. She <span class="pink">still wouldn't look at me either, and <span class="pink">every time</span> I <span class="grey">sort of</span> <span class="lightBlue">put</span> my <span class="orange">hand</span> on her <span class="orange">shoulder</span> <span class="grey">or something, </span>she wouldn't let me. "Listen, do you <span class="green">want</span> to <span class="lightBlue">go</span> for a walk?" I asked her. "Do you <span class="green">want</span> to take <span class="red">a walk</span><span class="purple"> down to the zoo</span>? If I let you not <span class="lightBlue">go back </span><span class="purple">to school</span><span class="pink"> this afternoon</span>
                           and <span class="lightBlue">go</span> for <span class="red">walk</span>, will you <span class="grey">cut out</span> this <span class="middleBlue">crazy</span> <span class="grey">stuff</span>?" She wouldn't answer me, so I said <span class="red">it</span> <span class="middleBlue">over again</span>. "If I let you skip <span class="red">school</span> <span class="pink">this afternoon</span> and <span class="lightBlue">go</span> for a <span class="middleBlue">little</span> <span class="red">walk</span>, will you <span class="grey">cut out</span> the <span class="black">crazy</span> <span class="grey">stuff?</span> Will you <span class="lightBlue">go back</span> <span class="purple">to school </span><span class="pink">tomorrow</span> like a <span class="middleBlue">good</span> <span class="red">girl</span>?" "I may and I may not," she said. Then she <span class="lightBlue">ran</span> <span class="middleBlue">right</span><span class="grey"> the hell</span> <span class="purple">across the street</span>, without even looking to see if <span class="red">any cars</span> were <span class="lightBlue">coming</span>. She's a <span class="grey">madman</span> <span class="pink">sometimes</span>. I didn't <span class="lightBlue">follow</span> 
                           <span class="red">her</span>, though. I <span class="green">knew</span> she'd <span class="lightBlue">follow</span> <span class="red">me</span>, so I started <span class="lightBlue">walking </span><span class="purple">downtown toward the zoo, on the park side of the street</span>, and she started <span class="lightBlue">walking </span><span class="purple">downtown on the other</span> <span class="grey">goddam </span><span class="purple">side of the street</span>, She wouldn't look over at me <span class="middleBlue">at all</span>, but I could tell she was <span class="middleBlue">probably</span> watching <span class="red">me</span> out of<span class="red"> the corner</span> of her <span class="black">crazy </span><span class="orange">eye</span> to see <span class="purple">where</span> I was <span class="lightBlue">going</span><span class="grey"> and all. </span><span class="middleBlue">Anyway</span>, we kept <span class="lightBlue">walking</span> <span class="middleBlue">that way all the way</span> <span class="purple">to the zoo</span>. The <span class="middleBlue">only</span> thing that <span class="black">bothered</span> <span class="red">me</span> was <span class="pink">when</span> a <span class="middleBlue">double-decker</span> bus <span class="lightBlue">came</span> along because 
                           then I couldn't see <span class="purple">across the street</span> and I couldn't see <span class="purple">where</span> <span class="grey">the hell</span> she was. But <span class="pink">when <span class="lightBlue">we got</span> <span class="purple">to the zoo</span>, I <span class="grey">yelled over</span> to her, "<span class="blue">Phoebe</span>! I'm <span class="lightBlue">going </span><span class="purple">in the zoo</span>! <span class="grey">C'mon,</span> <span class="pink">now</span>!" She wouldn't look at me, but I could tell she heard <span class="red">me</span>, and <span class="pink">when</span> I <span class="lightBlue">started down</span> <span class="red">the steps</span> <span class="purple">to the zoo</span> I <span class="lightBlue">turned around</span> and saw she was <span class="lightBlue">crossing <span class="purple">the street</span> and <span class="lightBlue">following</span> <span class="red">me</span> <span class="grey">and all.</span> There weren't <span class="middleBlue">too many</span> people <span class="purple">in the zoo</span> because it was <span class="grey">sort of </span>a<span class="grey"> lousy</span> <span class="red">day</span>, but there were<span class="middleBlue"> a few</span> <span class="purple">around the</span> <span class="red">sea lions</span>'
                           <span class="purple">swimming pool</span> <span class="grey">and all.</span> I <span class="lightBlue">started to go</span> <span class="purple">by</span> but<span class="grey"> old</span> <span class="blue">Phoebe</span> stopped and made out she was watching the <span class="red">sea lions </span><span class="brown">getting fed</span>--a guy was <span class="lightBlue">throwing</span> <span class="red">fish</span> at <span class="red">them</span>--so I <span class="lightBlue">went back</span>. I <span class="green">figured</span> it was a <span class="middleBlue">good</span> <span class="red">chance</span> to catch up with her <span class="grey">and all.</span> I <span class="lightBlue">went up</span> and <span class="grey">sort of</span> <span class="green">stood</span> <span class="purple">behind her </span>and <span class="grey">sort of</span> <span class="lightBlue">put </span>my <span class="orange">hands</span> on her <span class="orange">shoulders</span>, but she <span class="lightBlue">bent</span> her <span class="orange">knees</span> and <span class="lightBlue">slid out</span> from me--she can <span class="middleBlue">certainly</span> be <span class="middleBlue">very</span> <span class="grey">snotty</span> <span class="pink">when</span> she <span class="green">wants</span> to. She kept <span class="green">standing</span> <span class="purple">there</span> 
                           <span class="pink">while</span> the <span class="red">sea lions</span> were getting fed and I <span class="green">stood</span> <span class="middleBlue">right </span><span class="purple">behind her</span>. I didn't <span class="lightBlue">put</span> my <span class="orange">hands</span> on her <span class="orange">shoulders</span> <span class="pink">again</span> <span class="grey">or anything</span> because if I had she really would've <span class="grey">beat it</span> on me. Kids are <span class="middleBlue">funny</span>. You have to watch <span class="red">what</span> you're doing. She wouldn't <span class="lightBlue">walk</span> <span class="middleBlue">right </span><span class="purple">next to me</span> <span class="pink">when</span> <span class="lightBlue">we left</span> <span class="red">the sea lions</span>, but she didn't <span class="lightBlue">walk </span><span class="middleBlue">too far away</span>. She <span class="grey">sort of </span><span class="lightBlue">walked</span> <span class="purple">on one side of the sidewalk</span> and I <span class="lightBlue">walked</span> <span class="purple">on the other side</span>. It wasn't <span class="middleBlue">too gorgeous</span>, but it was <span class="middleBlue">better</span> than having her <span class="lightBlue">walk</span> <span class="middleBlue">about</span> <span class="purple">a mile away</span> from me, 
                           <span class="middleBlue">like</span> <span class="pink">before</span>. We <span class="lightBlue">went up</span> and watched <span class="red">the bears</span>, <span class="purple">on that </span><span class="middleBlue">little</span> <span class="purple">hill</span>, <span class="pink">for a while</span>, but there wasn't <span class="middleBlue">much </span>to watch. <span class="middleBlue">Only </span>one of the <span class="red">bears </span>was <span class="purple">out</span>, the <span class="red">polar bear</span>. The <span class="middleBlue">other</span> one, the <span class="middleBlue">brown</span> <span class="red">one</span>, was <span class="purple">in his</span> <span class="grey">goddam</span> <span class="purple">cave</span> and wouldn't <span class="lightBlue">come out</span>. All you could see was <span class="red">his</span> <span class="grey">rear end.</span> There was a <span class="middleBlue">little</span> <span class="red">kid</span> <span class="green">standing</span> <span class="purple">next to me</span>, with a <span class="red">cowboy hat</span> on <span class="middleBlue">practically</span> <span class="purple">over his ears</span>, and he kept telling his father, "Make <span class="red">him</span> <span class="lightBlue">come out</span>, <span class="grey">Daddy</span>. Make <span class="red">him</span> <span class="lightBlue">come out</span>." 
                           I looked at <span class="grey">old</span> <span class="blue">Phoebe</span>, but she wouldn't laugh. You <span class="green">know</span> <span class="red">kids</span> <span class="pink">when</span> they're <span class="black">sore</span> at you. They won't laugh <span class="grey">or anything. </span><span class="pink">After</span> <span class="lightBlue">we left</span> <span class="red">the bears</span>, we <span class="lightBlue">left</span> <span class="purple">the zoo</span> and <span class="lightBlue">crossed over</span> this <span class="middleBlue">little </span><span class="purple">street in the park</span>, and then we <span class="lightBlue">went through</span> one of those <span class="middleBlue">little </span><span class="purple">tunnels</span> that <span class="pink">always</span> <span class="brown">smell</span> from somebody's <span class="grey">taking a leak. </span>It was <span class="purple">on the way to the carrousel</span>. <span class="grey">Old</span> <span class="blue">Phoebe</span> <span class="pink">still</span> wouldn't talk to me <span class="grey">or anything,</span> but she was <span class="grey">sort of</span> <span class="lightBlue">walking</span> <span class="purple">next to me</span> <span class="pink">now</span>. I <span class="lightBlue">took</span> a hold of <span class="red">the belt</span>
                           <span class="purple">at the back </span>of her <span class="red">coat</span>, just <span class="grey">for the hell of it,</span> but she wouldn't let<span class="red"> me</span>. She said, "<span class="green">Keep</span> your <span class="orange">hands</span> to yourself, if you don't mind." She was <span class="pink">still</span> <span class="black">sore</span> at me. But not as <span class="black">sore</span> as she was <span class="pink">before</span>. <span class="middleBlue">Anyway</span>, we kept <span class="lightBlue">getting</span> <span class="middleBlue">closer</span> and <span class="middleBlue">closer</span> <span class="purple">to the carousel </span>and you could start to hear that <span class="middleBlue">nutty </span><span class="red">music</span> it <span class="pink">always </span>plays. It was playing "<span class="blue">Oh, Marie</span>!" It played that <span class="middleBlue">same</span> <span class="red">song</span> <span class="pink">about fifty years ago when</span> I was a<span class="middleBlue"> little</span> <span class="red">kid</span>. That's one <span class="middleBlue">nice</span> <span class="red">thing</span> about <span class="red">carrousels</span>, they <span class="pink">always</span> play the <span class="middleBlue">same</span> <span class="red">songs.</span> "I <span class="green">thought </span><span class="red">the carrousel</span>
                           was <span class="middleBlue">closed</span> <span class="pink">in the wintertime,</span>" <span class="grey">old</span> <span class="blue">Phoebe</span> said. It was <span class="pink">the first time </span>she <span class="middleBlue">practically</span> said <span class="red">anything</span>. She <span class="middleBlue">probably</span> forgot she was supposed to be <span class="black">sore</span> at me. "<span class="middleBlue">Maybe</span> because it's <span class="pink">around Christmas</span>," I said. She didn't say <span class="red">anything</span> <span class="pink">when</span> I said <span class="red">that.</span> She <span class="middleBlue">probably</span> remembered she was supposed to be <span class="black">sore </span>at me. "Do you <span class="green">want </span>to <span class="lightBlue">go</span> for a <span class="red">ride</span> <span class="purple">on it?</span>" I said. I <span class="green">knew</span> she <span class="middleBlue">probably</span> did. <span class="pink">When</span> she was a <span class="middleBlue">tiny little</span> <span class="red">kid</span>, and <span class="blue">Allie</span> and <span class="blue">D.B.</span> and I used to <span class="lightBlue">go</span> <span class="purple">to the park</span> with her, she was <span class="black">mad</span> about <span class="red">the carrousel</span>. You couldn't <span class="lightBlue">get her off</span>
                           the <span class="grey">goddam </span>thing. "I'm <span class="middleBlue">too big</span>." she said. I <span class="green">thought</span> she wasn't going to answer me, but she did. "No, you're not. <span class="lightBlue">Go on</span>. I'll <span class="green">wait</span> for <span class="grey">ya</span>. <span class="lightBlue">Go on</span>," I said. We were <span class="middleBlue">right</span> <span class="purple">there</span> then. There were <span class="middleBlue">a few</span> <span class="red">kids</span> <span class="lightBlue">riding</span> <span class="purple">on it</span>, <span class="middleBlue">mostly very little</span> <span class="red">kids</span>, and <span class="middleBlue">a few</span> <span class="red">parents</span> were <span class="green">waiting around</span> <span class="purple">outside</span>, <span class="green">sitting</span> <span class="purple">on the benches</span> <span class="grey">and all. </span><span class="red">What</span> I did was, I <span class="lightBlue">went up</span> <span class="purple">to the window where</span> they <span class="lightGreen">sell</span> <span class="red">the tickets</span> and <span class="lightGreen">bought</span> <span class="grey">old </span><span class="blue">Phoebe </span><span class="red">a ticket.</span> <span class="pink">Then</span> I <span class="lightBlue">gave</span>
                           <span class="red">it</span> to her. She was <span class="green">standing</span> <span class="middleBlue">right </span><span class="purple">next to me</span>. "Here," I said. "<span class="green">Wait</span><span class="pink"> a second</span>--<span class="lightBlue">take</span> <span class="red">the rest </span>of your <span class="lightGreen">dough</span>, too." I started <span class="lightBlue">giving</span> her <span class="red">the rest</span> of the <span class="lightGreen">dough</span> she'd <span class="lightGreen">lent</span> me. "You <span class="green">keep</span> <span class="red">it</span>. <span class="green">Keep</span> <span class="red">it</span> for me," she said. <span class="pink">Then</span> she said <span class="middleBlue">right </span><span class="pink">afterward</span>--"Please." That's <span class="black">depressing</span>, <span class="pink">when </span>somebody says "please" to you. I mean if it's <span class="blue">Phoebe </span>or <span class="red">somebody</span>. That <span class="black">depressed</span> <span class="grey">the hell</span> out of me. But I <span class="lightBlue">put </span>the <span class="lightGreen">dough</span> <span class="lightBlue">back</span> <span class="purple">in my pocket</span>. "Aren't you <span class="grey">gonna</span> <span class="lightBlue">ride</span>, too?" she asked me. She was looking at me <span class="grey">sort of</span>
                           <span class="middleBlue">funny</span>. You could tell she wasn't <span class="middleBlue">too</span> <span class="black">sore</span> at me <span class="pink">any more</span>. "<span class="middleBlue">Maybe</span> I will <span class="pink">the next time</span>. I'll watch <span class="grey">ya</span>," I said. "<span class="lightBlue">Got</span> <span class="red">your ticket</span>?" "Yes." "<span class="lightBlue">Go</span> ahead, then--I'll be <span class="purple">on this bench right over here</span>. I'll watch <span class="grey">ya.</span>" I <span class="lightBlue">went over</span> and <span class="green">sat down</span> <span class="purple">on this bench</span>, and she <span class="lightBlue">went</span> and <span class="lightBlue">got</span> <span class="purple">on the carrousel</span>. She <span class="lightBlue">walked</span> all <span class="purple">around it</span>. I mean she <span class="lightBlue">walked </span><span class="pink">once</span> <span class="middleBlue">all the way</span> <span class="purple">around it</span>. Then she <span class="green">sat down</span> <span class="purple">on this </span><span class="middleBlue">big, brown</span>, <span class="grey">beat-up-looking</span> <span class="black">old</span> <span class="purple">horse</span>. Then the carrousel started, and I watched <span class="red">her</span> <span class="lightBlue">go </span><span class="purple">around</span>
                           and <span class="purple">around</span>. There were <span class="middleBlue">only about five or six other</span> <span class="red">kids</span> <span class="purple">on the ride</span>, and the <span class="red">song</span> the carrousel was playing was <span class="blue">"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes."</span> It was playing <span class="red">it</span> <span class="middleBlue">very jazzy and funny. All</span> the kids kept trying to <span class="lightBlue">grab</span> for the <span class="red">gold ring</span>, and so was <span class="grey">old</span> <span class="blue">Phoebe</span>, and I was <span class="grey">sort of</span> <span class="black">afraid</span> she'd <span class="lightBlue">fall off</span> the <span class="grey">goddam </span>horse, but I didn't say <span class="red">anything</span> or do <span class="red">anything.</span> The thing with <span class="red">kids </span>is, if they <span class="green">want</span> to <span class="lightBlue">grab</span> <span class="red">the</span> <span class="middleBlue">gold</span><span class="red"> ring</span>, you have to let <span class="red">them</span> do <span class="red">it</span>, and not say <span class="red">anything.</span> If they <span class="lightBlue">fall off</span> they <span class="lightBlue">fall off</span>, but it's <span class="black">bad</span> if you say <span class="red">anything</span> to them. <span class="pink">When</span> <span class="red">the ride</span> was <span class="middleBlue">over</span>
                           she <span class="lightBlue">got </span><span class="purple">off her horse</span> and <span class="lightBlue">came over</span> <span class="purple">to me</span>. "You <span class="lightBlue">ride</span> <span class="pink">once</span>, <span class="middleBlue">too</span>, <span class="pink">this time</span>," she said. "No, I'll <span class="middleBlue">just</span> watch <span class="grey">ya</span>. I <span class="green">think</span> I'll<span class="middleBlue"> just</span> watch," I said. I <span class="lightBlue">gave</span> her <span class="middleBlue">some more</span> of her <span class="lightGreen">dough</span>. "Here. <span class="lightBlue">Get</span> some <span class="red">more tickets</span>." She <span class="lightBlue">took</span> the <span class="lightGreen">dough</span> <span class="lightBlue">off </span>me. "I'm not <span class="black">mad</span> at you <span class="pink">any more</span>," she said. "I <span class="green">know</span>. <span class="lightBlue">Hurry up</span>--the thing's <span class="grey">gonna</span> start <span class="pink">again</span>." <span class="pink">Then all of a sudden</span> she <span class="lightBlue">gave</span> me <span class="red">a kiss</span>. Then she <span class="green">held</span> her <span class="orange">hand</span> out, and said, "It's raining. It's starting to rain." "I <span class="green">know</span>." Then <span class="red">what </span>she did--it
                           <span class="grey">damn near killed me-</span>-she<span class="lightBlue"> reached</span> <span class="purple">in my coat pocket</span> and <span class="lightBlue">took out</span> my <span class="middleBlue">red hunting </span><span class="red">hat</span> and <span class="lightBlue">put </span>it on my <span class="orange">head</span>. "Don't you <span class="green">want</span> <span class="red">it</span>?" I said. "You can <span class="green">wear</span> <span class="red">it</span> <span class="pink">a while</span>." "Okay. <span class="lightBlue">Hurry up</span>, though, <span class="pink">now</span>. You're <span class="grey">gonna </span>miss your <span class="red">ride</span>. You won't get your own <span class="red">horse</span> <span class="grey">or anything.</span>" She kept <span class="grey">hanging around</span>, though. "Did you mean <span class="red">it</span> what you said? You <span class="middleBlue">really</span> aren't <span class="lightBlue">going away</span> <span class="purple">anywhere</span>? Are you <span class="middleBlue">really</span> <span class="lightBlue">going</span> <span class="purple">home</span> <span class="pink">afterwards</span>?" she asked me. "Yeah," I said. I meant <span class="red">it,</span> <span class="middleBlue">too</span>. I wasn't <span class="black">lying</span> to her. I <span class="middleBlue">really</span> did <span class="lightBlue">go</span>
                           <span class="purple">home</span> <span class="pink">afterwards</span>. "<span class="lightBlue">Hurry up</span>, <span class="pink">now</span>," I said. "The <span class="red">thing's</span> starting." She <span class="lightBlue">ran</span> and <span class="lightGreen">bought</span> her <span class="red">ticket</span> and <span class="lightBlue">got back</span> <span class="purple">on the</span> <span class="grey">goddam</span> <span class="purple">carrousel</span> <span class="middleBlue">just</span> <span class="pink">in time. Then</span> she <span class="lightBlue">walked</span> <span class="middleBlue">all the way</span> <span class="purple">around it</span><span class="pink"> till </span>she <span class="lightBlue">got </span>her own <span class="red">horse</span> <span class="lightBlue">back</span>. Then <span class="lightBlue">she got</span> <span class="purple">on it</span>. She <span class="lightBlue">waved</span> to me and I <span class="lightBlue">waved back.</span> <span class="grey">Boy</span>, it began to rain <span class="grey">like a bastard. In buckets, I swear to God.</span> <span class="middleBlue">All</span> the <span class="red">parents</span> and <span class="red">mothers</span> and <span class="red">everybody</span> <span class="lightBlue">went over</span> and <span class="green">stood</span> <span class="middleBlue">right</span> <span class="purple">under the roof of the carrousel</span>, so they wouldn't get
                           <span class="grey">soaked to the skin or anything,</span> but I <span class="grey">stuck around</span><span class="purple"> on the bench</span> <span class="pink">for </span><span class="middleBlue">quite </span><span class="pink">a while</span>. I got <span class="middleBlue">pretty</span> <span class="grey">soaking wet, </span><span class="middleBlue">especially</span> my <span class="orange">neck</span> and my <span class="red">pants</span>. My <span class="middleBlue">hunting</span> <span class="red">hat</span> <span class="middleBlue">really</span> <span class="lightBlue">gave</span> me <span class="middleBlue">quite a lot </span>of <span class="red">protection,</span> <span class="middleBlue">in a way;</span> but I got <span class="middleBlue">soaked anyway</span>. I didn't care, though. I felt <span class="middleBlue">so </span><span class="grey">damn</span> <span class="middleBlue">happy</span> <span class="pink">all of sudden</span>,<span class="middleBlue"> the way</span> <span class="grey">old</span> <span class="blue">Phoebe</span> kept <span class="lightBlue">going</span> <span class="purple">around</span> and <span class="purple">around</span>. I was <span class="grey">damn</span> <span class="middleBlue">near</span> <span class="black">bawling</span>, I felt <span class="middleBlue">so </span><span class="grey">damn</span> <span class="middleBlue">happy</span>, if you <span class="green">want</span>
                           to <span class="green">know</span> <span class="red">the truth</span>. I don't <span class="green">know</span> <span class="red">why</span>. It was <span class="middleBlue">just</span> that she looked <span class="middleBlue">so</span> <span class="grey">damn</span> <span class="middleBlue">nice, the way</span> she kept <span class="lightBlue">going</span> <span class="purple">around</span> and <span class="purple">around</span>, <span class="middleBlue">in her blue coat</span> <span class="grey">and all. God</span>, I <span class="green">wish</span> you could've been <span class="purple">there</span>.

                           That's <span class="red">all</span> I'm going to tell about. I could <span class="middleBlue">probably</span> tell you <span class="red">what</span> I did <span class="pink">after</span> I <span class="lightBlue">went</span> <span class="purple">home</span>, and <span class="middleBlue">how</span> I got <span class="black">sick </span><span class="grey">and all,</span> and <span class="red">what</span> <span class="purple">school</span> I'm supposed to <span class="lightBlue">go</span> to <span class="pink">next fall, after</span> I <span class="lightBlue">get out</span> of <span class="purple">here</span>, but I don't <span class="grey">feel like it. I</span> <span class="middleBlue">really</span> don't. That <span class="grey">stuff</span> doesn't interest <span class="red">me</span> <span class="middleBlue">too much</span> <span class="pink">right now</span>. <span class="middleBlue">A lot of</span> <span class="red">people,</span> <span class="middleBlue">especially </span>this one <span class="red">psychoanalyst guy</span> they have <span class="purple">here</span>, <span class="green">keeps</span> asking me if I'm going apply <span class="red">myself</span> <span class="pink">when</span> I <span class="lightBlue">go back</span> <span class="purple">to school</span> <span class="pink">next September</span>. It's <span class="middleBlue">such</span> a <span class="black">stupid</span>
                           <span class="red">question</span>, in my opinion. I mean <span class="middleBlue">how</span> do you <span class="green">know</span> what you're going to do <span class="pink">till</span> you do <span class="red">it</span>? The answer is, you don't. I <span class="green">think</span> I am, but <span class="middleBlue">how</span> do I <span class="green">know</span>? I swear it's a <span class="black">stupid</span> <span class="red">question</span>. <span class="blue">D.B.</span> isn't as <span class="black">bad</span> as the rest of <span class="red">them</span>, but he <span class="green">keeps </span>asking me <span class="middleBlue">a lot of</span> <span class="red">questions,</span> too. He <span class="lightBlue">drove over</span> <span class="pink">last Saturday</span> with this <span class="middleBlue">English </span><span class="grey">babe </span>that's <span class="purple">in this new picture </span>he's <span class="lightBlue">writing</span>. She was <span class="middleBlue">pretty affected</span>, but <span class="middleBlue">very good-looking. Anyway</span>, <span class="pink">one time when</span> she <span class="lightBlue">went</span><span class="purple"> to the ladies' room</span> way <span class="grey">the hell</span> down <span class="purple">in the other wing</span> <span class="blue">D.B.</span> asked me what 
                           I <span class="green">thought </span>about all this <span class="grey">stuff</span> I <span class="pink">just </span>finished telling you about. I didn't <span class="green">know</span> <span class="red">what</span> <span class="grey">the hell </span>to say. If you <span class="green">want</span> to <span class="green">know</span> <span class="red">the truth</span>, I don't <span class="green">know</span> <span class="red">what</span> I <span class="green">think</span> about <span class="red">it</span>. I'm sorry I told <span class="middleBlue">so many</span> <span class="red">people</span> about <span class="red">it</span>. About all I <span class="green">know </span>is, I <span class="grey">sort of</span> miss <span class="red">everybody</span> I told about. <span class="middleBlue">Even</span><span class="grey"> old </span><span class="blue">Stradlater and Ackley,</span> <span class="middleBlue">for instance</span>. I <span class="green">think</span> I <span class="middleBlue">even</span> <span class="black">miss</span> that <span class="grey">goddam</span> <span class="blue">Maurice</span>. It's <span class="middleBlue">funny</span>. Don't ever tell anybody <span class="red">anything</span>. If you do, you start missing <span class="red">everybody. </span>
